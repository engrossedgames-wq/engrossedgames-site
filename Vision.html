									<h3 class="major">The Future of Engrossed Games: Creating Unforgettable Legaciesr</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Vision.png" alt="" /></span>At Engrossed Games, our vision extends beyond just creating video games: we aspire to build a studio where innovation and a passion for storytelling converge into unique projects, developed sustainably and destined to endure in history. Our path is one of conscious expansion, aiming to grow our talented team to bring to life the grand stories and ideas that simmer in our imagination, transforming them into more ambitious gaming experiences without compromising our unwavering pursuit of quality.</p>
									<p>We dream of forging large communities that intertwine around our universes and stories. We want every game not only to entertain but to resonate deeply, leaving the player pondering long after the screen turns off, with messages of value that inspire and provoke thought. Sustainability is key on this journey, ensuring that our creativity flourishes responsibly, allowing us to continue exploring the limits of interactive narrative.</p>
                                    <p>Our promise is simple: unshakeable quality and the creation of unforgettable stories. We seek to evoke that unmistakable "wow" sensation in every corner of our worldsâ€”that breathtaking awe upon discovering a new landscape or an unexpected plot twist. We yearn for our narratives to leave a lasting impression, sparking deep reflection and an emotional connection that lingers for days.</p>
									<h3 class="major">A Mark of Awe and Creative Freedom</h3>
									<p>What truly sets Engrossed Games apart is the creative freedom we value above all else. We are not bound by conventions; this autonomy allows us to unleash our imagination without external restrictions, a canvas where the combined talent of Juan Ignacio and Daniel can fully manifest. This freedom is the pillar upon which we build every universe, every character, and every narrative, ensuring that each experience is an authentic reflection of our vision and passion.</p>
