									<h3 class="major">Our Connection and Shared Vision</h3>
									<p>At Engrossed Games, we firmly believe that great stories are born from a shared vision and a deep connection. Our adventure began when Juan Ignacio Orrego, an Argentinian based in Spain, and Daniel Castro, a Mexican established in his home country, met during a collaborative project. At that moment, we discovered an undeniable affinity, a synergy in our working style that transcended geographical distance.</p>

									<p>What unites us is not only the efficiency of our collaboration but also a mutual fascination with aesthetics, a keen eye for detail, and above all, an unwavering passion for hard science fiction stories. This universe of possibilities, where imagination meets plausibility, fuels our creativity and is the fertile ground where our best ideas germinate. Engrossed Games is our sanctuary, a space of freedom where we unleash our imagination to reflect our personality as developers and creators of immersive experiences.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Our Philosophy and Commitment</h3>
									<p>Our philosophy is clear: to create immersive experiences that captivate. We strive for excellence in every aesthetic detail, exploring new narratives and generating products of exceptional quality, imbued with a distinct personality. We know that great games are born from dedication, and although we are a small team, we focus on developing compact yet incredibly dense and high-value titles. Each project is a declaration of intent, a testament to our commitment to the art of video games and quality narrative.</p>
